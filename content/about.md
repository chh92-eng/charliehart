## Who I Am

I grew up in the north of the San Francisco Bay Area, just south of Sonoma and Napa. Environmentalism runs deep in the North Bay, and I learned from a very young age that caring for the natural world around me is of the utmost importance. In 2017, the SMART train came to the region, introducing me to the world of comfortable, accessible, and impactful public transportation. This train allowed me to attend school 30 miles from home in Santa Rosa, CA. Since then, my passions for sustainability and transportation have been driving forces in my academic journey and my career aspirations.

I aim to utilize my education in engineering to build a career that allows me to bring reliable and sustainble transportation options to not only the North Bay, but the entire Bay Area. I spent much of my childhood exploring San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley, so I hold a great deal of love for those cities as well.

## Where I'm At

I'm a fourth-year mechanical engineering student at Cornell University pursuing a Master's Degree in systems engineering, which I intend to begin this January at Cornell alongside my undergraduate degree.
This site is my personal space to share projects, writing, and ideas.

## Outside of Work

During my time in college, I was a member of the Cornell Men's Alpine Ski Team. Skiing was a big passion for my dad, so I enjoyed getting to spend the time improving my abilities. I've spent my life visiting Tahoe, and my dad has lived in both Sun Valley, ID and Portland, OR for a little while, so I got to grow up playing after hours on the ski slopes of the bunny hills of some of the most revered resorts in the nation.

Similarly, I spent some time with the Cornell Gymnastics Club. Whereas skiing is something I share with my dad, gymnastics is something I share with my mom. My mom and I used to love practicing gymnastics and acrobatics together, so the club was an excuse to keep practicing my handstands and flips.

My favorite thing to do is travel. I have driven from one side of the country to the other multiple times, and every time I've taken a different route, because I love discovering new places and understanding new parts of the world around me. I've been lucky enough to do a few international trips on my own or with some friends.
