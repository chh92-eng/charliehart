# Hi, I’m Charlie Hart!

I'm a fourth-year mechanical engineering student at Cornell University pursuing a Master's Degree in systems engineering, which I intend to begin this January at Cornell alongside my undergraduate degree.
This site is my personal space to share projects, writing, and ideas.

Interests:

- travel
- trains
- developments (sf, boston)
- skiing
- need to talk about things that i actually go and do something about
