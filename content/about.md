## Who I Am

I grew up in the northern San Francisco Bay Area, just south of Sonoma and Napa. The North Bay has a strong sense of environmental awareness, and that mindset shaped how I see the world. When the SMART train started running in 2017, it opened my eyes to how good public transportation can connect communities. That train made it possible for me to attend school 30 miles away in Santa Rosa, and it sparked my interest in sustainable transportation and urban systems.

I want to use my engineering background to help improve transportation across the Bay Area, especially in the North Bay, where access is limited. I’ve spent a lot of time exploring San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley, and I care deeply about making those cities more connected and livable for the people who call them home.

## Where I'm At

I’m a fourth-year Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University and will begin my Master of Engineering in Systems Engineering this January, continuing here at Cornell alongside my undergraduate studies.

## Outside of Work

During college, I was part of the Cornell Men’s Alpine Ski Team. Skiing has always been something I’ve shared with my dad, and it’s a big part of our family life. I grew up spending time in Tahoe, and my dad has lived in places like Sun Valley and Portland, Oregon, so skiing has been around me for as long as I can remember.

I also joined the Cornell Gymnastics Club. Gymnastics is something I’ve always connected with through my mom — we used to practice together when I was younger, and the club gave me a chance to keep it up and stay active.

I love to travel and see new places. I’ve driven across the U.S. several times, always taking different routes, and I’ve been lucky to visit a few countries abroad. Traveling helps me see how different people live and gives me new perspectives on the world around me.
