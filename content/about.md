## Background & Motivation
I grew up in the North Bay, just south of Sonoma and Napa—an area shaped by strong environmental values and a regional focus on sustainability. When the SMART train launched in 2017, it fundamentally changed how I viewed transportation. It made it possible for me to attend school 30 miles away in Santa Rosa and showed me how high-quality transit can expand access, connect communities, and strengthen a region.

That experience sparked my interest in sustainable mobility, rail systems, and the engineering decisions behind how cities function. I care deeply about improving transportation in the Bay Area—especially in the North Bay, where transit access is limited. Exploring San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley has further shaped my interest in how infrastructure, planning, and engineering influence the daily lives of the people they serve.

## Education & Experience
I am a fourth-year Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University and will begin my Master of Engineering in Systems Engineering this January through Cornell’s integrated undergraduate–graduate program. I expect to graduate in December of 2026.

My work spans mechanical design, prototyping, computational modeling, and systems thinking. I’ve contributed to projects involving rover wheel design, LoRaWAN device development, wind-turbine blade optimization, and internal-combustion engine analysis—experiences that have strengthened both my technical foundation and my ability to work across multidisciplinary teams.

## Engineering Interests
My engineering interests sit at the intersection of mechanical design, systems engineering, and transportation. I enjoy taking ideas from concept to physical reality—whether through CAD modeling, prototyping, machining, or integrating mechanical components into larger systems. I’m also drawn to the systems side of engineering: defining requirements, understanding how subsystems interact, evaluating reliability, and using structured methods to design solutions that scale. Much of my work involves computational tools, including Python for simulation, numerical modeling, optimization, and data visualization, as well as embedded systems and sensor integration for real-world applications. These technical skills connect directly to my passion for transportation: I’m especially interested in rail systems, multimodal mobility, and how engineering and planning come together to improve regional connectivity and urban development in cities like San Francisco and Boston. Ultimately, I aim to apply engineering tools and systems thinking to build more efficient, accessible, and sustainable transportation networks.

## Beyond Engineering
Outside of academics, I’ve been a member of the Cornell Men’s Alpine Ski Team—a sport that has been part of my life since childhood, skiing in Tahoe with my dad and spending winters in mountain towns across the West. I also joined the Cornell Gymnastics Club, which connects back to practicing with my mom when I was younger.

I love to travel and explore new places. I’ve driven across the United States several times on different routes and visited multiple countries abroad. Experiencing different communities, cities, and ways of life has broadened my perspective and continually influences how I think about mobility, design, and infrastructure.
