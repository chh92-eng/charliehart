  For this project, I was a part of a team was tasked with designing the blades for a small-scale wind turbine that would operate within strict geometric and performance constraints. The turbine had to use a standardized 1-inch hub, accept blades no longer than 6 inches, and run at a fixed angular velocity not exceeding 2000 RPM. We were also required to optimize performance for a wind environment characterized by a Weibull distribution with parameters k = 5 and c = 5, representing typical mid-range wind conditions.

The objective was to engineer a blade geometry that maximized aerodynamic efficiency under these operating conditions while remaining fully manufacturable for 3D printing and compatible with the course’s testing apparatus. The final design included a complete aerodynamic analysis, CAD modeling of the optimized geometry, and preparation for downstream fabrication and testing.

## Design Process
To develop an efficient and manufacturable blade, I wrote a custom Python script that automated the full aerodynamic design and optimization workflow. The script began by generating interpolated lift and drag polars for the NACA 4412 airfoil across the Reynolds-number range expected on a 6-inch blade. These polars served as inputs to a Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT) model that I also implemented in Python, allowing us to compute induced velocities, aerodynamic loading, and the local flow angle at each radial station.

Using these results, the script iteratively updated the chord and twist distributions to maintain an optimal angle of attack and circulation distribution along the span. Each iteration combined the BEMT solution with ideal loading expressions, Prandtl tip and root loss models, and numerical stabilization techniques to ensure convergence under low-Reynolds conditions near the hub. Once the aerodynamic solution stabilized, I incorporated smoothing routines to ensure the final geometry met manufacturability constraints and the project’s axial projection limits.

  After the optimized geometry converged, the Python script exported the chord, twist, and radial positioning data needed for CAD modeling. Using the design parameters I generated, my teammate created a full 3D model of the blade assembly, which our instructor then sent to an external fabrication partner for high-resolution SLA printing using Accura 25. The resulting parts closely matched our intended geometry and provided a durable prototype suitable for wind-tunnel evaluation. The printed blades were later used for experimental testing in the course.

To determine the power output of our blade, we constructed the wind turbine using the three 3D-printed blades and a provided aluminum hub. The turbine was then mounted in a wind tunnel, where my group members and I could run the blade at different wind speeds. Over a range of **3.17 m/s** to **5.56 m/s**, at four separate constant wind velocities, we applied torque from a 5BZ Magnetic Particle Brake. Using a VI, we could determine the power generated by recording the rate of rotation and the torque applied by the brake. As we increased the torque for each test, we collected data that would allow us to construct a series of power curves. At our highest velocity, our blade acheived a power output of 1.29 Watts.

## Results

Our final blade prototype successfully produced over 1 W of power during testing and maintained full structural integrity under load. Although the design targeted peak performance around **5.04 m/s**, the measured output continued to rise through **5.56 m/s** without a clear performance plateau, suggesting the blade had additional operating headroom.

During testing we also observed a resonance or transitional behavior between **2100–2500 RPM**, which did not compromise performance but indicates a dynamic region worth further study. While the blade was designed for a tip-speed ratio (TSR) of ~3, the experimental system consistently operated closer to **TSR ≈ 6**, showing that the rotor performed effectively even outside its intended design envelope. Overall, the prototype was under-designed relative to its achieved operating conditions but still delivered strong and consistent performance.

## Future Iterations (Hypothetical)

If this project were continued, several refinements could be explored to better align the blade geometry with its experimentally observed operating regime:

- **Increase the design TSR**, since the experimental rotor naturally operated at much higher tip-speed ratios than expected.
- **Investigate the unusual aspects of the current geometry**, especially the chord and twist interactions at outer stations.
- **Experiment with larger chord lengths** at higher radii to improve aerodynamic loading where our blade showed margin.
- **Characterize and mitigate the resonance zone** to make dynamic behavior more predictable across RPM ranges.

These adjustments would help bridge the gap between the original design assumptions and the conditions under which the blade actually performed best.
