As part of my undergraduate degree, I completed an indtroductory course in Internet of Things Technology (Cornell University MAE 4220). 
With a team of three other classmates, I created a device that is capable of creating a map of the range of LoRaWAN gateway.
We collaborated with representatives from the cities of Syracuse and Geneva in Upstate New York so they could use our technologies for municipal projects, such as live flood level monitoring
during rainstorms.
My main contribution was the physical design for the device. Utilizing AutoCAD Inventor, I designed the protective casing to be easily handheld and compact, while ensuring the circuitry inside
would be secure.
