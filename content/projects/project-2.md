## Team Objective

**Cornell Mars Rover** is an extracurricular, for-credit engineering project team that designs and builds a fully autonomous Mars rover each year. The rover is developed for the **University Rover Challenge (URC)** in Utah, hosted by *The Mars Society* each May, where teams are judged on system performance and mission execution in Mars-like terrain.

## Project Overview

As a member of the Drives Subteam of the Cornell Mars Rover Project, I worked with a partner to design and fabricate the rover’s wheel and hub assembly — a critical component responsible for traction, weight distribution, and durability under harsh terrain. The Drives Subteam oversees all frame, suspension, and wheel systems, with a major focus on weight optimization due to the competition’s 50-kilogram limit for the full rover.

  </figure>
  My project focused on developing a new lightweight wheel and hub system that could withstand rugged desert conditions while remaining manufacturable and easily serviceable. The design used 3D-printed airless tires made from TPU filament, paired with machined aluminum hubs. The assembly was designed to be interoperable with both airless and pneumatic tires, allowing quick replacements in the event of a failure during manufacturing or testing too close to the competition date to remedy. The resulting system balanced flexibility, durability, and weight efficiency — key factors for competition performance. This project strengthened my skills in CAD modeling, manufacturing, and design for assembly, while also teaching me how to collaborate across mechanical, electrical, and software subteams to integrate a reliable system for a real-world competition rover. My time with the team also allowed me to build familiarity with ANSYS softwares for load analysis.

## My Role

<p style="text-align:justify;">

  </figure>
  I was responsible for the mechanical design and prototyping of the new wheel and hub system. Working in Autodesk Inventor, I modeled and refined the tire and hub geometry, ensuring precise fit between the TPU tire, aluminum hubs, and torque-transmitting spacers. I produced detailed shop drawings for manufacturing and earned certification to operate mills and lathes, allowing me to directly translate my CAD models into physical components.
</p>

A major design challenge was ensuring that the airless tire’s internal supports deformed predictably under load. In previous rover designs, the trusses connecting the inner and outer rims bent in inconsistent directions, creating uneven stresses and premature failure. To solve this, my partner and I designed arched support structures that reliably flexed inward under compression, maintaining a smooth outer rim profile and distributing loads evenly across the wheel.

  </figure>
  Throughout the project, I applied geometric constraints, tolerance analysis, and assembly modeling to ensure consistent part alignment during both fabrication and testing. Beyond the functional design, I focused on practical and aesthetic refinements—such as curved spoke patterns for controlled deformation and powder-coated matte-black hubs for a durable, professional finish.

  My work on this project allowed me to build strong skills in using CAD software, specifically Autodesk Inventor, for modeling complex prototypes and creating detailed assemblies. I designed both the tire and hub geometry, ensuring proper fit between the TPU-printed tire, aluminum hubs, and torque-transmitting spacers. I also learned how to apply geometric constraints and tolerances that ensured consistent alignment between parts during assembly and testing. Beyond function, I incorporated visual and practical design details—such as curved spoke patterns for controlled deformation and powder-coated matte black hubs—to produce a robust and professional-looking final product.

### Physical Testing

Once the prototype wheel assembly was completed, I conducted a series of physical tests to evaluate its performance under realistic loading conditions. Using a custom-built test rig consisting of parts I manufactured, I applied more than 25 kilograms of compressive force to the wheel to measure deflection and observe material behavior. These tests revealed how the TPU tire deformed between spacers and confirmed that the hub system withstood expected loads without failure. I analyzed deformation patterns to ensure the spokes bent predictably inward, validating the design’s intended behavior under stress. The results informed minor geometric refinements and guided future improvements, including additional torque and roll testing planned with the suspension team.
