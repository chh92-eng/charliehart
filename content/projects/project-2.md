As a member of the Cornell Mars Rover project team, I worked closely with a partner to develop a tire and hub system for the rover. The goal of the project team is to design a Mars Rover each year for the University Rover Competition held in Utah in late May and early June.

Within this team, I was a part of the Drives Subteam, which focus on design the frame, legs, and wheels of the rover. My task was to work with my partner to develop a new wheel and hub system that reduced the total weight of the wheel systems on the rover. The competition rules set the maximum weight for the rover at 50 kilograms, so weight optimization is a large part of the responsibility for Drives Subteam engineers.

We decided to design a tire and hub system that would utilize airless tires, produced using TPU filament on a 3D printer. The system was designed with the intent that if the airless tires were to catastrophically fail, they could be easily replaced with pneumatic tires. This meant we had to create a hub that could be interoperable with different types of tires.

When designing the tires themselves, my partner and I studied different designs for airless tires, such as previous rover designs or tires from Michelin. In previous iterations of the rover that utilized airless tires, the main shortfall was the unpredictability of the direction of bending experienced by the support trusses within the two rims of the tires. To remedy this, my partner and I designed the wheel to have arched supports between the two rims that would reliably bend inwards upon one another when they experienced high loads. This would ensure smooth geometry of the outer rim as it compressed against the ground. If the supports were to bend in opposing directions, it would lead to uneven distributions of strength, inducing higher loads upon certain sections of the wheel and lower loads along other portions. Our design ensured loading was even across the entirety of the wheel experiencing the load at one time.
